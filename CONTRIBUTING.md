# Contributing Guidelines

Do not modify the`master` branch directly. You can only merge to it.

## Starting a New Feature

- Make a new branch from `dev`: `git checkout -b branch-name`
- Always rebase your branch to update it with the latest changes from `dev`: `git pull origin dev --rebase`
- Now you can make changes
- Once changes are commited, push them: `git push origin branch-name`
- Create a pull request from GitHub and assign a team member to review your code
